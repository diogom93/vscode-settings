# VS Code Settings

These are my personal VS Code settings. I am commiting this so I can keep them synced across machines.
Feel free to use them as a starting point to create your own personal configuration :)

To keep the file synced with the repo without the need for copying and pasting, go to the repository folder and type the following command in your terminal (macOS):

```
ln -f settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
